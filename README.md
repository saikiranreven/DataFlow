# DataFlow
Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline on Google Cloud

Objective
To build a real-time data processing pipeline using Google Cloud services that can ingest, process, analyze, and archive streaming data. This solution enables low-latency insights and scalable data ingestion for real-time use cases.

üåê Architecture Overview
The architecture is designed to simulate and ingest real-time streaming data using Cloud Pub/Sub, process it using Dataflow (Apache Beam), store analytical output in BigQuery, and archive raw data in Cloud Storage for backup or future batch processing.
